<h3> Set </h3>

Set is a collection of unique values. Apart from the common operations of adding and removing items from a set there are other
operations that can be applied to a pair of sets.

<ul>
<li>Union — This combines all the items from two different sets and returns this as a new set (with no duplicates).</li>
<li>Intersection — Given two sets, this function returns another set that has all items that are part of both sets.</li>
<li> Difference — This returns a list of items that are in one set but NOT in a different set. </li>
<li> Subset — This returns a boolean value that shows if all the elements in one set are included in a different set.</li>
</ul>
