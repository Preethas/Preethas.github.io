A programming paradigm is a style of writing code.

There are many programming paradigms available apart from the ones which we are familiar with and use in our daily life
<ul>
 <li> Imperative </li>
 <li> Declarative </li>
 <li> Object Oriented </li>
</ul>

Over the last year I have been fascinated by the power of declarative programming . This paradigm focusses on 
"what the task is " rather than "how the task is done"

<h2> Example 1 <h2>

Map operation - Projects an array taking each element and transforming it
Filter operation - Filters elements from an array that match a given condition

The fiddle below is an illustration of how we can implement our own filter and map operations

<h2> Example 2 <h2>

ConcatAll - Flattening strategy that converts an n dimensional array into an n-1 dimensional array

The fiddle below is an illustration of how we can implement our own concatAll operation



<h2> Example 3 <h2>

Reduce - Reduces an array into a single element

The fiddle below is an illustration of how we can implement our own reduce operation
