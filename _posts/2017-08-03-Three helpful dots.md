<h3> Spread operator </h3>

<p> With ES6 comes the spread operator that is helpful in many ways.The spread operator spreads an array into individual entries  </p>

<h5> Copying arrays </h5>

Pre ES6

<div class="code">

var arr = [1,2,3];
var copy  = arr.slice();

</div>



<h5> Placing an array in a specific index within another array </h5>

<h5> Concat arrays </h5>


<h5> Call methods that have several parameters </h5>
